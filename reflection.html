            Social Media —— Data Visualisation Design
        </h2>
        <p>
            <li>With years of experience working in social media, I have a strong sensitivity to data and information. Data visualization helps me to find invisible problems and areas for improvement. 
                <br>
                <br>In the process, I started to think about easier-to-read and effective visualizations that could help me make better decisions. That was my initial impression of data visualization.

            Science/Technology —— Data Visualisation
        </h2>
        <p>
            <li>In addition, my childhood interest in science and technology has given me a strong interest in exploring the boundaries of technology and modern human life. It also drove my main interest in design: exploring how art and design can be visualized through technology.

            </li>
            <li>My first data visualization project was 'AI Is Searching You', a project I did in 2021 on algorithmic image recognition for artificial intelligence. This project further established my main design research direction of exploring the relationship between artificial intelligence and the role of humans in modern society. The project started as an experiment driven by interest and intuition, and then I began to think about how to represent the feeling of people being gazed at by AI through algorithmic visualization. It also gave me an initial insight into how data visualization can be used to represent stories, not just to help with decision-making.  (Braun, 2017)

            ‘A good story grabs your attention and takes you on a journey, evoking an emotional response … story is a time-tested structure; humans have been communicating with stories throughout history. We can leverage this powerful tool for our [visual] communications.’ (Cole Nausbaum Knaflic, 2015)
        </h2>
        <p>
            <li>In the first plastics data-led workshop of this Unit, Aristotle's three-act structure (Syd Field, 1979) started to give me a deeper understanding and inspiration on how to tell data storytelling, which helped my collaborative project 'Microplastic in Thames River' focused on the ubiquity of microplastics around our lives.
            </li>
            <li>During the research, we discovered that the Thames River is a major source of water for Londoners but is one of the most polluted rivers in the world for microplastics (Rowley, Katharine H., 2020).

          Data represents real life. (Lupi, 2017) 
      </h2>
      
      <p>
          <li>Thus, In the process of selecting data for The Microplastics Project, Lupi's data humanism has inspired me and helped me to develop a wider understanding of data visualization design: 
          </li>
          <li>
            data can be found in lives and personal experiences, data visualization is everywhere (Lupi, 2017). We need to find patterns and overlooked stories in a wide range of complex information and communicate them effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            This led to the final proposal to collect microplastic samples from the Thames in London through primary research (Lupi, 2017).

          Embrace Complexity (Lupi, 2017)

      <p>
          <li>Data visualization can be multi-layered. More understanding of the Consider Context (Catherine D'Ignazio, 2020), can help to make projects richer and more layered.

          </li>
          <li>
            The Sound Walk Project has helped me to understand the context of the data better by going out into real life to get the data for analysis (Lupi, 2017). This project also got me very interested in sound visualization and exploring data visualization in life.

          No algorithm is perfect.  (O'Neil. C, 2017)
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            <li>The Data Feminism concept of 'Rethink Binaries' (Catherine D'Ignazio, 2020) and perspectives on invisible bias in Invisible Women (Criado-Perez, Caroline, 2019), led me to focus my research on the issue of algorithmic bias. Most people don't know much about technology and algorithmic bias because it is too sophisticated and complex, but it affects people's lives all the time (O'neil, C., 2016).
            </li>
            <li>The Anatomy of an AI System project gives a good example of algorithmic data visualization. (Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler, 2018). It drove me to start thinking about exploring more ways of visualizing data to show algorithmic bias.
            </li>
            <li>Practical coding projects and physical interaction with hands-on learning have contributed to my technical practice to some extent. Although it was mostly driven by my interest. During this practice, I was able to learn how algorithms work and how the visual effects presented by different programming languages, software and hardware are interesting, multi-sensory and easily understood. These practices have been very helpful in my exploration of algorithmic bias in data visualization. I will consider how multi-sensory experiences can be incorporated into my projects, and in this regard, I was also inspired by the data feminist 'Elevate Emotion and Embodiment'. (Catherine D'Ignazio, 2020).

            Teamwork ——Individual Exploration
        </h2>
        <p>
            <li>Through a series of practical teamwork projects, it has become clearer to me that I need to do more individual projects at this stage to explore. In the beginning, I enjoyed working in teams because I enjoyed sharing ideas and thoughts with everyone and I learned a lot in the process. Because most of the time everyone in the team is doing what they are good at, and I need more time to explore and settle in my direction at this stage, I need to do a lot of things that I am not good at to make it something I am good at. Although collaboration is very necessary and important. 
            </li>
            <li>In particular, I was impressed by the importance of establishing the basic principles of teamwork. During the UN-Women project, the smoothness of the collaboration was based on well-established ground rules and the recording and review of every meeting (Levin, 2005). It ensures that everyone can trust each other and synchronize information. 
            </li>
            <li> 
              Also, in this project, the lack of feedback from our partners led to a significant change of direction in the final output within a short period. Although it was delivered on time thanks to a proactive approach to solving the problem. However, it made me realize that when we don't get feedback, we need to be more proactive in getting feedback and communicating to ensure the final output is achieved.

            Skills Develop
        </h2>
        <p>
            <li>In reviewing the Collaborative project, I realized that it didn't allow me to use all of my strengths, such as shooting video and motion graphic design, but many projects didn't allow me to develop these skills, which further led me to identify that I needed more time to focus on individual projects and that I would like to incorporate these skills into my future projects if possible.

            Action Plan
        </h2>
        <p>
            <li>In this unit, I realized that as a designer with social responsibility, it is socially relevant to explore how technology and AI can be expressed through data visualization design to help people understand scientific and algorithmic biases (Melles, G., de Vere, I. and Misic, V., 2011). 
            </li> 
            <li>Then, I set a goal of exploring ways of visualizing data through technology and AI from my perspective as a visual designer, to help people understand the technology and algorithmic biases more intuitively and understandably or to increase emotional representation (Klein and D'Ignazio, 2020) through more diverse technical practices.
